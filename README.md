# 📚 Bookstore API

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress** - This project is currently under active development. Features are being implemented incrementally following Clean Architecture principles.

A modern RESTful API for managing a bookstore built with .NET 9 and Clean Architecture principles. This project demonstrates enterprise-level software development practices with comprehensive authentication, authorization, and CRUD operations.

## 🌟 Overview

The Bookstore API enables users to register, authenticate, browse books, and place orders. It features role-based access control with separate permissions for regular users and administrators, making it suitable for real-world e-commerce scenarios.

### 🚧 Current Development Status

This project is being developed incrementally to sharpen .NET development skills and demonstrate Clean Architecture implementation. The foundation has been established with:

- ✅ **Project Structure**: Clean Architecture layers properly organized
- ✅ **Domain Layer**: Book and User entities with comprehensive business logic
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Entity Framework Core setup with SQL Server and User support
- ✅ **Application Layer**: Book DTOs with comprehensive validation attributes
- ✅ **API Foundation**: ASP.NET Core Web API with Swagger documentation
- ✅ **Input Validation**: DataAnnotations validation implemented for Book DTOs
- ✅ **Role-Based Design**: User roles (User/Admin) prepared for authorization
- ✅ **Order System**: Order and OrderItem entities implemented with business logic
- 🚧 **Authentication**: JWT implementation in progress
- 🚧 **CRUD Operations**: Book management endpoints in development

**Note**: Some features mentioned in this README are planned but not yet implemented. Check the [Upcoming Features](#-upcoming-features) section for the current roadmap.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── Bookstore.Domain/          # Business entities and domain logic
├── Bookstore.Application/     # Application services and DTOs
├── Bookstore.Infrastructure/  # Data access and external concerns
└── Bookstore.Api/            # Web API controllers and configuration
test/
└── Bookstore.Tests/          # Unit and integration tests
```

## 🚽️ Getting Started

> ⚠️ **Note**: The application is currently in development. Some setup steps may not work as expected until core features are fully implemented.

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [SQL Server LocalDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-express-localdb) or SQL Server instance
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installation

   ```

2. **Restore dependencies**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Update connection string**
   
   Edit `src/Bookstore.Api/appsettings.json`:
